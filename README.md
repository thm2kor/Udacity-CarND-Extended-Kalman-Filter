# Extended Kalman Filter Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

The objective of this project is to estimate the state of a moving object with noisy measurements from lidar and radar sensors.
The moving objects state is represented by two dimensional position p<sub>x</sub>, p<sub>y</sub> and two dimensional velocity v<sub>x</sub>, v<sub>y</sub>. The state vector x is therefore:
